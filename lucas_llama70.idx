Processes the files in chunks, where each chunk is a set of files to be summarized by the LLM client.\n4.  Saves the results of file processing to the index file.\n5.

            "processing_result": "The lucas directory is the main package of the Lucas project, a large language model (LLM) that can index and query source code repositories. It includes several modules and tools for interacting with LLMs, processing files and directories, and handling user input. The package is organized into several subdirectories, including clients for interacting with various language model APIs, a prompts directory containing templates for large language model queries, and tools for tasks such as file editing, Git repository management, and testing.\n\nKey components of the package include the Indexer class for creating and managing the index file, the LLMClient factory function for creating clients to interact with LLMs, and the RateLimiter class for enforcing rate limits on service requests. Relationships between files and directories in this directory are primarily contained within the individual modules and tools, which are designed to be used together as part of a larger workflow or toolchain. For example, the Indexer class is used to create and manage the index file, which is then used by the LLMClient to summarize files and directories. The RateLimiter class is used to enforce rate limits on service requests made by the LLM client.\n\nThe setup.py script, a child of the lucas directory, is a setup script for the lucas package that defines the package's metadata and dependencies, and can be used to install the package using pip. It also defines an entry point for the package, which is the main entry point for the lucas script. Overall, the lucas directory provides a comprehensive suite of tools and modules for building and interacting with large language models, and is designed to be used as the basis for a wide range of applications and workflows.",
