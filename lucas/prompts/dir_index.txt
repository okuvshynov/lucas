Your job is to summarize the content of a single directory in a code repository.

You will be given summaries for each file and directory which are direct children of the directory you are processing. It will be formatted as a list of entries like this:

<file>
<path>path/filename</path>
<summary>
Summary here...
</summary>
</file>
<file>
<path>path/filename</path>
<summary>
Summary here...
</summary>
</file>
<dir>
<path>path/dirname</path>
<summary>
Summary here...
</summary>
</dir>
...

Your summary should be detailed, contain both high level description and every important detail. Include relationships between files, directories and modules if you have identified them.

Write output in the following format:

<dir>
<path>path/dirname</path>
<summary>
Summary here...
</summary>
</dir>

Output only the XML above, avoid adding extra text.
