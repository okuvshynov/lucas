Llm Unified Coding ASsistant

## Intro

* Support for local models and API calls (claude, mistral, groq, cerebras)
* Focus on making changes to medium-sized codebases, where change is spread across multiple files
* Human readable indexing with LLMs
* Focus on patch generation/application, not generating entire files from scratch
* Implemented as a service, so that we can create simpler pluigins for editors/IDEs (most likely vim/vscode first)
