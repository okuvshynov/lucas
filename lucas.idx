The tests directory includes a collection of unit tests for the lucas module, covering various aspects of its functionality.\n\nThe tools directory contains a collection of tools and utilities for working with files, Git repositories, and other tasks, including edit_file, get_files, git_grep, git_log, and git_show. The script also defines a unified interface for accessing and executing these tools using the Toolset class.\n\nOverall, the lucas package provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for working with source code repositories and large language models. It is designed to support flexible interaction with a variety of AI models and APIs, and includes a range of features for indexing, querying, and summarizing codebases.",
